# Invitation Tracker 🎟️

**Invitation Tracker** is an open-source web application designed to help users generate unique invitation codes for specific individuals. The code generator allows users to verify the codes through the app, making it easier to manage invitations for events or services. This project is community-driven, and we welcome contributions from developers around the world. 🚀

## Purpose

The purpose of the **Invitation Tracker** is to streamline the process of creating and managing invitation codes. Whether for events, promotions, or services, this application ensures that each invitation code is unique and verifiable. We’re not saying it’ll make you the life of the party, but it might just make your invitation management as smooth as a buttered slide! 🧈✨
